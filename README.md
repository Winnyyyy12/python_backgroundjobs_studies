# Python Background Jobs

This project demonstrates how to run **background tasks** in Python using different concurrency techniques such as **Threading, Multiprocessing, and AsyncIO**.  
It focuses on building **beginner-friendly examples** of background job execution like photo and video downloading using urls, file compressor and decompressor, Tic-tak-toe game.

## Project    Overview

| **Section**              | **Details** |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|  **Goal**              | To understand how Python handles tasks concurrently and in parallel, making programs more efficient and responsive. |
|  **Concurrency Used**  | - **Threading** (lightweight concurrent tasks)<br>- **Multiprocessing** (parallel jobs using multiple CPU cores)<br>- **AsyncIO** (asynchronous I/O bound tasks) |
|  **Tech Stack**        | - **Python 3.x**<br>- Modules: `threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`, `time`, `os` , `request`, `shutil`, `random`, `gzip`|
|  **Code Style**        | Beginner-friendly code with clear comments and modular structure |
